    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Isabell Banks is a young woman ready to jump into the world of music supervision. She has an interesting background when she grew up in New Jersey, went to middle school in the Bay Area, high school in Los Angeles and College in  New. All these places have helped her gain a sense of many cultures, and experience multitudes of music. She is currently ending her junior year at Loyola University New Orleans. She is a Music Industry Studies Business major with a minor in marketing. 
        Isabell has always wanted to work in the field of music. When she was young she wanted to be an actress/singer. She was always in plays, taking vocal lessons, and when she moved to L.A. she did some background work. When she entered college she knew she wanted to do something that combine music and business. During her sophomore year she was looking for internships and came across a music supervision internship. She read the definition and immediately started doing her research. After discovering what music supervision was she knew that was exactly what she wanted. Unfortunately she did not get that specific internship but one as a social media manager at a boutique label called One Crow Music Group. She works under North Caronlina Jameka Whitten and has recently been hired by them. Isabell is using her time around her boss to not only help manage the artist/labelâ€™s social media, but learn from her work ethic. She values her job, but is ready to pursue her real passion in music supervision. Her goal in music supervision is to find underrated songs and place them in films and tv shows.
